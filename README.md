## COE3DY4 project

### Project Overview
This repository contains my work on a Real-Time Software Defined Radio (SDR) system for Mono/Stereo FM and RDS, developed as part of the Computer Systems Integration Project at McMaster University. The project demonstrates my capabilities in handling the complexities and challenges of real-time signal processing within constrained environments. 

### Project Description
The SDR system is designed to:
- Receive and process FM broadcast signals in both mono and stereo formats.
- Decode and present Radio Data System (RDS) information transmitted alongside standard FM broadcasts.
- Operate efficiently under custom sample rates and various signal processing constraints specific to our project group.

### Technical Highlights
- **Language & Tools**: The system is primarily developed in C/C++.
- **Signal Processing**: Features custom digital signal processing algorithms to handle FM demodulation and RDS decoding.
- **Optimization**: Focus on optimizing performance for real-time execution within constrained computing environments.

### Project Outcome
Successfully implementing this project highlighted my proficiency in navigating complex digital signal processing concepts and translating them into real-world applications, solidifying my grasp on the practical aspects of software-defined radio technologies in a constrained computational environment.
